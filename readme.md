# [Frontend Developer Learning Guidance](#intro)
This is an evolving list of things I can think of, that I'd recommend a person take. The list is biased in that it prefers resources that were written end-to-end by one or two authors. I am not a fan of just reading random articles on the inter-webs to piece together a knowledge base.  
Note: Levvel has a license to frontendmasters.com, egghead.io, and Wes Bos's advanced react course.  

## [First, a question.](#first)
Ask yourself, "How do I learn things best?" and be honest. Its easy to say "watching videos" but that can be a passive activity if you aren't careful, where you blast through an 8 hour course but didn't retain anything. Anything that gets your hands on the keys is good but you also don't want to just noodle around because it feels more comfortable than cracking open a book.

## [A Well-meaning Rant](#ranting)
People who have dived head-first into the kool-aid filled pool of React & Redux are a dime a dozen. If you fancy yourself a Frontend Web Developer or wish to become one I _urge_ you to please learn the fundamentals. This means a solid grasp of the JavaScript language, semantic markup, and CSS. Do you need to be able to recite every bit of JS trivia someone can think of? Absolutely not. You just need to _get_ most of its nuances, especially if this is your first programming language. If you're being expected to write React code _right now_ and need to start, by all means, jump ahead to the React section and get some quick understanding but please do come back to the fundamentals of JS one day.

## [Fundamentals](#fundamentals)
I can think of no resource that does a better job of introducing someone to the craft of User Interface Development on the web. This book assumes you know almost nothing. It can be boring at times, but these topics matter. Writing good semantic markup that is accessible and findable is a skill i'm noticing many are leaving out these days. Writing bullet-proof CSS is also among that list of rare skills.  

[InterACT with Web Standards: A holistic approach to web design](https://www.amazon.com/InterACT-Web-Standards-holistic-approach/dp/0321703529)
It is a bit old of a text by now, but the fundamentals haven't changed.

## [Javascript](#javascript)
### Reading-Based
[The MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
_The_ JavaScript reference.

[You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
It is hard to beat Kyle Simpson's "You Don't Know JS" book series. It will give you a firm and thorough understanding of JavaScript. It can be read for free, too.

### Lecture Based
Pretty much the path laid out by frontendmasters is hard to beat, if you've got the time.
[Frontend Masters JS Path](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/javascript/)
1. [JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/)
2. [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/)
3. [Deep JavaScript Foundations, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/deep-javascript-v3/)
4. [JavaScript: The Recent Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-recent-parts/)
5. [Javascript: The New Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-new-hard-parts/)
6. [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/)
7. [Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript (with Rx.js Observables)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/asynchronous-javascript/)


## [React](#react)
### Introductory
[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
Probably the most important article to read in regard to React.

### Project-Based
[Wes Bos's Advanced React Course](https://advancedreact.com/)
Levvel owns a license to this course.

### Lecture Based
[Complete Intro to React v4](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/)
[Intermediate React](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react/)

## [Redux](#redux)
### Introductory
[Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
At the very least, read the entire "Introduction" section of the Documentation.
[When should I use Redux?](https://redux.js.org/faq/general#when-should-i-use-redux)
A valid question worth asking yourself, often.
[Redux Observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable)
This provides a solution to when you _want_ side-effects to occur in redux. Understanding RxJS will be very important, however.
[Learn RxJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io/)

### Lecture Based
[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
[Advanced State Management](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-state)
