# Frontend Developer Learning Guidance
This is an evolving list of things I can think of, that I'd recommend a person take. The list is biased in that it prefers resources that were written end-to-end by one or two authors. I am not a fan of just reading random articles on the inter-webs to piece together a knowledge base.  
Note: Levvel has a license to frontendmasters.com, egghead.io, and Wes Bos's advanced react course.  

# First, a question.
Ask yourself, "How best do I learn things?" and be honest. Its easy to say "watching videos" but that can be a passive activity if you aren't careful, where you blast through an 8 hour course but didn't retain anything. Anything that gets your hands on the keys is good but you also don't want to just noodle around because it feels more comfortable than cracking open a book.

# Fundamentals
I can think of no resource that does a better job of introducing someone to the craft of User Interface Development on the web. This book assumes you know almost nothing. It can be boring at times, but these topics matter. Writing good semantic markup that is accessible and findable is a skill i'm noticing many are leaving out these days. Writing bullet-proof CSS is also among that list of rare skills.  

[InterACT with Web Standards: A holistic approach to web design](https://www.amazon.com/InterACT-Web-Standards-holistic-approach)
It is a bit old of a text by now, but the fundamentals haven't changed.

# Javascript
## Reading-Based
[The MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
_The_ JavaScript reference.

[You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
It is hard to beat Kyle Simpson's "You Don't Know JS" book series. It will give you a firm and thorough understanding of JavaScript. It can be read for free, too.

## Lecture Based
Pretty much the path laid out by frontendmasters is hard to beat, if you've got the time.

# React
## Introductory
[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
Probably the most important article to read in regard to React.

## Project-Based
[Wes Bos's Advanced React Course](https://advancedreact.com/)
Levvel owns a license to this course.

## Lecture Based
[Complete Intro to React v4](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/)
[Intermediate React](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react/)

# Redux
## Introductory
[Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
At the very least, read the entire "Introduction" section of the Documentation.
[When should I use Redux?](https://redux.js.org/faq/general#when-should-i-use-redux)
A valid question worth asking yourself, often.
